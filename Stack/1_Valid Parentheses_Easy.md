# Valid Parentheses 
You are given a string s consisting of the following characters: `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`.

The input string `s` is valid if and only if:

Every open bracket is closed by the same type of close bracket.
Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
Return `true` if `s` is a valid string, and `false` otherwise.

### Example 1:
```python
Input: s = "[]"

Output: true
```
Example 2:
```python
Input: s = "([{}])"

Output: true
```
Example 3:
```python
Input: s = "[(])"

Output: false
```
Explanation: The brackets are not closed in the correct order.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        Map = {")": "(", "]": "[", "}": "{"}
        stack = []

        for c in s:
            if c not in Map:
                stack.append(c)
                continue
            if not stack or stack[-1] != Map[c]:
                return False
            stack.pop()

        return not stack
```
