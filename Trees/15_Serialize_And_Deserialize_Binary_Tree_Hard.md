# Serialize And Deserialize Binary Tree
Implement an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree.

Serialization is the process of converting an in-memory structure into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored or sent across a network to be reconstructed later in another computer environment.

You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure. There is no additional restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.

Note: The input/output format in the examples is the same as how NeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format.

### Example 1:

![example 1](https://imagedelivery.net/CLfkmk9Wzy8_9HRyug4EVA/a9dfb17f-70e9-42a3-ba97-33cfd82f6100/public)

```python
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
```

### Example 2:

```python
Input: root = []

Output: []
```

### Constraints:
- `0 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 1000.`
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Codec:
    
    # Encodes a tree to a single string.
    def serialize(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> str:
        res = []

        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                res.append('N')
                return 
            res.append(str(root.val))
            dfs(root.left)
            dfs(root.right)
        dfs(root)
        return ','.join(res)
        
    # Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    def deserialize(self, data: str) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        vals = data.split(',')
        self.i = 0

        def dfs():
            if vals[self.i] == "N":
                self.i += 1
                return None
            node = TreeNode(int(vals[self.i]))
            self.i += 1
            node.left = dfs()
            node.right = dfs()
            return node

        return dfs()
```
